# Flipper files

Thanks to [Z3BRO](https://github.com/Z3BRO) for the idea and to [UberGuidoZ](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ) to regroup all the files

  1. Open the folder which corresponds to the firmware you are running (OFW for official firmware OR CFW for custom firmware).

  2. Insert your Flipper's microSD card into your PC.
  3. Drag everything inside of the folder you opened to your Flipper's microSD card.
